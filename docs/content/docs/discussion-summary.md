# Architecture Discussion Summary

> Historical planning notes from the earlier UI phase.
> Keep this page as background only.
> For the current migration state, use [MIGRATION.md](../../../MIGRATION.md), [architecture](./architecture/), [frontend-react](./frontend-react/), [frontend-svelte](./frontend-svelte/), and [spice-backend](./spice-backend/).

## How to read this page

This document captures an earlier architecture discussion, not the live implementation contract.
Some ideas here aged well, some were only partially realized, and some are now explicitly outdated.

### Still useful

- backend-pluggable compute direction
- YAML compatibility as a core constraint
- the separation between chart definitions and computed data
- the need for precise time navigation and transit-oriented workflows

### Outdated or incomplete

- DuckDB + Parquet are described here as the active computed-data persistence model; that is not the current live Rust desktop behavior
- several sections assume the earlier Svelte-first UI phase
- some checklists below describe planned work that was later implemented differently, deferred, or replaced by Tauri/Rust-first paths

### Prefer these docs for live state

1. [architecture](./architecture/)
2. [frontend-react](./frontend-react/)
3. [frontend-svelte](./frontend-svelte/)
4. [tauri-command-contracts](./tauri-command-contracts/)
5. [spice-backend](./spice-backend/)

## Your Key Requirements

1. ✅ **User defines initial conditions** → UI forms → Tauri commands → compute routing
2. ✅ **Python can handle computation** → optional sidecar with CLI interface
3. ⚠️ **Persistent local storage** → this page assumes DuckDB + Parquet for time series; the current Rust desktop app does not persist computed chart data that way
4. ✅ **YAML compatibility** → Keep workspace/charts in YAML (same as Python package)
5. ✅ **2-chart relations** → Primary use case (transits, synastry)
6. ✅ **3-body relations** → Future-proof schema design
7. ⚠️ **Query-optimized** → discussed here in DuckDB/Parquet terms; current runtime reality is more mixed and command-driven

## Architecture Decisions

### Storage Strategy: Hybrid YAML + DuckDB

**Why this approach:**

- **YAML for metadata**: Charts, subjects, workspace config are human-readable and match Python package
- **DuckDB for computed data**: Fast queries on time series, efficient storage, SQL interface
- **Parquet for archival**: Long-term storage, columnar format, compression

**Structure:**

```
workspace/
├── workspace.yaml          # Metadata (compatible with Python)
├── charts/*.yaml          # Chart definitions
└── data/
    ├── workspace.db      # DuckDB (positions, relations)
    └── positions/*.parquet  # Partitioned time series
```

### Python Sidecar Performance

**Performance considerations:**

- **Async communication**: Tauri commands are async, Python runs in background
- **Minimal overhead**: Only serialization/deserialization cost
- **Background processing**: Long computations don't block UI
- **Caching**: Store results in DuckDB, avoid recomputation

**When to consider Rust port:**

- If computation becomes bottleneck (>100ms per chart)
- If you need real-time updates (every second)
- If binary size is critical

**Historical recommendation**: Start with Python sidecar, measure performance, port only if needed.

**Current preferred direction**: keep Python optional, keep computation provenance explicit, and avoid tying chart semantics to a single backend implementation.

### Relation Structure

**2-Chart Relations (Primary):**

```sql
relations table:
  - source_chart_id: Base chart (natal/event)
  - target_chart_id: Transit chart (current time)
  - relation_type: 'transit', 'synastry', 'progression'
```

**3-Body Relations (Future):**

```sql
relations table:
  - source_chart_id: Chart 1
  - target_chart_id: Chart 2
  - third_chart_id: Chart 3 (optional)
  - relation_type: 'composite_transit', 'triple_synastry', etc.
```

**Aspect Computation:**

- Aspects are computed on demand from stored positions
- No aspect tables or Parquet files are persisted

### Main Date Table Structure

**Core table: `computed_positions`**

- Primary key: `(chart_id, datetime, object_id)`
- Indexes: `(chart_id, datetime)`, `(object_id)`
- Stores: longitude, latitude, distance, speed, retrograde

**Relation table: `relations`**

- Links charts together
- Stores configuration snapshots (JSONB)
- Tracks computation settings (engine, ephemeris file)

**Aspect data**

- Derived at query time from `computed_positions`

### Date Format Handling

**Storage:**

- All dates stored as ISO 8601 strings or TIMESTAMP in DuckDB
- Original format preserved in chart YAML

**Query:**

- DuckDB handles timezone conversions
- Can query by any time format (converted to TIMESTAMP)

**Example:**

```sql
-- Store with original format metadata
INSERT INTO relations (..., original_date_format)
VALUES (..., 'julian_day', 2459845.5);

-- Query converts automatically
SELECT * FROM computed_positions
WHERE datetime >= '2024-01-01'::TIMESTAMP;
```

### Source File Set (JPL/swisseph)

**Storage:**

- `engine` column: 'jpl', 'swisseph', 'jyotish', 'custom'
- `ephemeris_file` column: Path to BSP file (for JPL)
- Stored per relation (can mix engines in same workspace)

**Query:**

```sql
-- Find all computations using de421.bsp
SELECT * FROM relations
WHERE engine = 'jpl' AND ephemeris_file LIKE '%de421%';

-- Get positions computed with specific engine
SELECT * FROM computed_positions
WHERE chart_id IN (
    SELECT chart_id FROM relations WHERE engine = 'jpl'
);
```

## Open Questions

### 1. Time Granularity

**Question**: What's the minimum time step for transit computations?

**Options:**

- **Hourly**: Good for short-term transits (days/weeks)
- **Daily**: Good for long-term transits (months/years)
- **Adaptive**: Hourly for near-future, daily for far-future

**Recommendation**: Start with daily, add hourly option later.

### 2. Storage Limits

**Question**: How much historical data to keep?

**Options:**

- **Unlimited**: Store everything (requires good partitioning)
- **Time-based**: Keep last N years, archive older
- **Size-based**: Keep until database reaches X GB

**Recommendation**: Start unlimited, add archival later if needed.

### 3. Real-time Updates

**Question**: Should transits update in real-time or on-demand?

**Options:**

- **On-demand**: Compute when user requests
- **Scheduled**: Background service computes daily/hourly
- **Hybrid**: On-demand for new ranges, scheduled for updates

**Recommendation**: On-demand initially, add scheduled updates later.

### 4. Multi-workspace

**Question**: Support multiple workspaces simultaneously?

**Options:**

- **Single**: One workspace at a time (simpler)
- **Multiple**: Switch between workspaces (more complex)

**Recommendation**: Single workspace initially, add multi-workspace later.

### 5. Export Formats

**Question**: What formats for exporting computed data?

**Options:**

- **CSV**: Simple, universal
- **JSON**: Structured, easy to parse
- **Parquet**: Efficient, preserves types
- **PDF**: Human-readable reports

**Recommendation**: Start with CSV and JSON, add others as needed.

## Next Steps

These were the original suggested next steps at the time of writing:

1. **Review this architecture** - Does it match your vision?
2. **Answer open questions** - Make decisions on granularity, storage, etc.
3. **Start Phase 1** - Implement basic chart creation
4. **Iterate** - Build incrementally, test with real data

For current work planning, do not continue from this section directly. Start from the live frontend/backend docs listed above.

## Key Files to Create

- `src-tauri/src/storage/duckdb.rs` - DuckDB integration
- `src-tauri/src/storage/parquet.rs` - Parquet file handling

### Python

- `external_package/module/cli.py` - CLI interface for Tauri
- `external_package/module/storage.py` - DuckDB helpers (optional)

### TypeScript/Svelte

- `src/lib/stores/computations.ts` - Computation state
- `src/lib/stores/data.ts` - Data querying
- `src/lib/components/TransitComputation.svelte` - UI component
- `src/lib/components/DataBrowser.svelte` - Data browsing UI

## Questions for You

1. **Time granularity preference?** (hourly, daily, adaptive)
2. **Storage limits?** (unlimited, time-based, size-based)
3. **Real-time vs on-demand?** (preference for transit updates)
4. **Multi-workspace needed?** (now or later)
5. **Export format priority?** (CSV, JSON, PDF, Parquet)

Once you answer these, we can finalize the architecture and start implementation!
